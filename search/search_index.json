Eco itself is just an Amazon Alexa skill which is an Amazon Voice Service. Eco has minimal dependencies that runs on Node.js JavaScript runtime. Eco uses a DynamoDB database on AWS Lambda function through Amazon's Web Services (AWS). To find out more about \nAWS Lambda\n click the link. To get started using Eco, follow the steps below. \n\n\nInstalling the Technology Stack\n\n\nBefore you can start working on our project, make sure you have the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn \nAmazon Developer\n account which allows access to a suite of tools and services to enable a developer to build, test, and sell applications/games in the Amazon Appstore. \n\n\nAn Amazon Web Service \n(AWS)\n account. This account does not have to be the same as your Amazon account, if you already have one. \n\n\nA Git account. \n\n\nThe Amazon Alexa app which you can download via your mobile device's app store for the purpose of connecting your Amazon Developer account to your Alexa compatible device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that while you can test your interaction through the Amazon developer console, \nit does not\n test for every interaction so having an Alexa comptabile device is recommended.\n\n\nGetting the Code\n\n\nHopefully Eco is set up as expected and by this point you can get the code by:\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/skl1m/Eco.git\n - Download the code.\n\n\ncd Eco\n - Change directories, going into the app folder\n\n\nnpm install\n - Install the dependencies\n\n\n\n\nRunning the Skill\n\n\nNext, make sure you're logged into your Amazon Developer account (remember this could be the same as your regular Amazon account) and your Amazon Web Services account. \n\n\n\n\nStart by \ncreating a new skill\n with a different name than Eco. Choose to make a custom skill.\n\n\nOnce you are taken to the console page which looks like this: then follow the skill builder checklist and complete each steps to be able to test the skill until you've reached step four (the endpoint). \n\n\nBefore completing the endpoint (step four), head over to your \nAWS account\n and create a lambda function.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these \nsteps\n to create a lambda function for an Alexa skill.\n\n\n\n\nIn the lambda function for your skill, after connecting your skill to the function and adding your ARN of your lambda function into your endpoint in the Amazon Developer console, you can begin to program in the lamda function and test in the developer console or through your Alexa device.\n\n\nTo set up the Alexa device, like the \nEcho Dot\n, follow the link. \n\n\nNow you can make changes to our project or create your own skill using our project as a reference!\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n At this moment, we have not looked into DynamoDB to store our data. We are just storing small amounts of information with the help of data structures. Consequently, implementing DynamoDB may change the steps of our installation guide.\n\n\nWhat to expect?\n\n\nAs of now, we are just creating the bare bones of our system. We want three of the four features of Alexa skill completed. However, next semester we hope to have all four features of our system to be fully implemented and tested. We hope to make use of DynamoDB to store all data for our skill as we are incorporating the \nUCSF recycling database\n information. Lastly, we want to have a paired website for our users to get information regarding Eco.\n\n\nWant to contribute?\n\n\nDid you find a bug or would like to suggest new features?
